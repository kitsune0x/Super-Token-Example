# Super Token - An ERC20 Token Deployment Example

## ERC-20 Deployment Example
This practice project contains my code for the purposes of proving my ability to deploy an ERC20 token called "Super Token" and node.js based Dapp to interface with the token on the test network.

This project uses the following technologies:
* Node.js
* Truffle Suite (React app)
* Chai test module
* Ropsten Test Network and Infura node
