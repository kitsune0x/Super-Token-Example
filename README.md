# Super Token - An ERC20 Token Deployment Example

## ERC-20 Deployment Example
**Super Token** is a Web3 example project. This project exists solely to demonstrate my ability to deploy an ERC-20 token, inherit from and write my own solidity smart contracts, and build a node.js based Dapp to interface with the token after it has been deployed onto the test network. The dapp allows a user to make a contract call to whitelist their address (anyone can whitelist their address for the purposes of this example), and then send Ether to a crowdsale contract to purchase Super Token (SPT). 

This project demonstrates my knowledge of the following technologies, programming languages, and modules:
* JavaScript
* Solidity
* Node.js
* Truffle Suite
* Solidity Smart Contracts
* Open Zeppelin Contracts 
* Web3
* Chai testing
* Ropsten Test Network
* Infura
