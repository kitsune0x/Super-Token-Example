# Super Token - An ERC20 Token Deployment Example

## ERC-20 Deployment Example
This practice project contains my code for the purposes of proving my ability to deploy an ERC20 token called "Super Token" and a node.js based Dapp to interface with the token after it is deployed onto the test network. The dapp allows a user to whitelist their address 

This project demonstrates my knowledge of the following technologies, programming languages, and modules:
* JavaScript
* Solidity
* Node.js
* Truffle Suite
* Solidity Smart Contracts
* Open Zeppelin Contracts 
* Web3
* Chai testing
* Ropsten Test Network
* Infura
